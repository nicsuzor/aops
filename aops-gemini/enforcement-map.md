# Enforcement Rules

**Purpose**: Current state of what's protected and how. For mechanism selection guidance, see [[ENFORCEMENT]]. For architectural philosophy, see [[enforcement]].

## Axiom Registry: Tiered Architecture

Axioms are organized into tiers, each enforced by a distinct agent personality. This section is the **manifest** — agents read it to discover which rule files to load for their context.

### Tier 1: Universal Axioms (always active)

**File**: `$AOPS/agents/enforcer.md` (canonical source; `$AOPS/AXIOMS.md` until retirement — epic task-2d73b052, subtask .8)
**Agent**: Enforcer (`aops-core/agents/enforcer.md`)
**Scope**: All work, all contexts, all platforms

Contains: P#3 (Don't Make Shit Up), P#5 (Do One Thing), P#6 (Data Boundaries), P#9 (Fail-Fast Agents), P#26 (Verify First), P#27 (No Excuses), P#30 (Nothing Is Someone Else's Responsibility), P#31 (Acceptance Criteria Own Success), P#50 (Explicit Approval), P#99 (Delegated Authority Only).

### Tier 2: Contextual Rules (activated by project context)

| Context     | File                              | Agent                          | Activates when                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Academic    | `$AOPS/skills/research/axioms.md` | Academic standards enforcer    | Research, teaching, publication work |
| Development | `$AOPS/agents/dev-standards.md`   | Engineering standards enforcer | Code, infrastructure, CI/CD work     |
| Framework   | `$AOPS/agents/framework-ops.md`   | Framework operations enforcer  | Working on/within academicOps        |

### Tier 3: Heuristics (advisory)

**File**: `$AOPS/HEURISTICS.md`
**Scope**: Inform but don't block. Checked periodically by custodiet/enforcer.

### How agents consume the registry

Domain rules are embedded in the agents and skills that own them (the bazaar model). Instead of loading different rule files into a general-purpose agent based on detected context, you invoke the right specialist agent for the job:

1. **Universal axioms** (Tier 1): Always active — loaded at SessionStart for all agents via `AXIOMS.md`. The rbg agent (`aops-core/agents/rbg.md`) carries these axioms as core knowledge for PR review and session audits
2. **Academic rules**: Owned by the research skill (`skills/research/axioms.md`) — active when the research skill is invoked
3. **Dev rules**: Owned by the dev-standards agent (`agents/dev-standards.md`) — invoke for code planning, review, or execution
4. **Framework rules**: Owned by the framework-ops agent (`agents/framework-ops.md`) — invoke for framework development or operations

No programmatic context detection required — the right agent for the job already has its rules (P#49).

**Note**: "Prompt" level rules are instructional. Compliance is not mechanically enforced but is checked periodically by custodiet.

### What Constitutes Prompt-Level Enforcement

Context loading follows a **three-tier architecture** (see [[session-start-injection]]):

| Tier | File                   | Purpose                          | When Loaded               |
| ---- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1    | `$AOPS/CORE.md`        | Framework tools (essential only) | SessionStart (ALL agents) |
| 2    | `$cwd/.agents/CORE.md` | Project-specific context         | SessionStart (if exists)  |
| 3    | `AXIOMS.md` etc.       | Detailed guidance                | JIT via hints             |

**Design principle**: Minimal baseline, maximal JIT. Agents start with only what they need to understand the framework and project. Everything else loads on-demand.

### File Loading Summary

| File                        | Purpose                         | Loaded Via                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `$AOPS/CORE.md`             | Framework tool inventory (~2KB) | SessionStart hook                |
| `$cwd/.agents/CORE.md`      | Project conventions             | SessionStart hook (if exists)    |
| `AXIOMS.md`                 | Tier 1: Universal axioms        | SessionStart (always)            |
| `agents/dev-standards.md`   | Tier 2: Development rules       | When dev-standards agent invoked |
| `agents/framework-ops.md`   | Tier 2: Framework rules         | When framework-ops agent invoked |
| `skills/research/axioms.md` | Tier 2: Academic rules          | When research skill invoked      |
| `HEURISTICS.md`             | Tier 3: Advisory heuristics     | JIT via hints                    |

## MCP Tool Injection Requirements

| Tool               | Exempt | Rationale                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `store_memory`     | **No** | Must route through `/remember` skill to create both markdown + memory (aops-887fba77) |
| `retrieve_memory`  | Yes    | Read-only, no state change                                                            |
| `recall_memory`    | Yes    | Read-only, no state change                                                            |
| Task manager tools | Yes    | Establish task binding (infrastructure)                                               |

## Periodic Compliance (Custodiet)

The custodiet hook (`hooks/router.py`) provides periodic semantic compliance checking via [[ultra-vires-custodiet]].

### Mechanism

| Parameter             | Value               | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `TOOL_CALL_THRESHOLD` | 50                  | Full compliance check every N tool calls             |
| Counted tools         | ALL tool calls      | Counter increments for every tool (Read, Edit, etc.) |
| Blocked tools         | MUTATING_TOOLS only | Only Edit/Write/Bash blocked at threshold            |

### Compliance Check (Threshold)

At threshold, spawns haiku subagent to review session transcript for:

- Axiom violations ([[fail-fast-code]], [[verify-first]], [[acceptance-criteria-own-success]])
- Heuristic violations ([[verification-before-assertion]], [[explicit-instructions-override]], [[questions-require-answers]])
- Drift patterns (scope creep, plan deviation)
- Insight capture (advisory) - flags when discoveries aren't persisted to remember skill

Uses `decision: "block"` output format to force agent attention. Insight capture is advisory only (no block).

**Enforcement mode**: `block` (default). Custodiet violations halt the session. Override via `CUSTODIET_GATE_MODE=warn` env var.

## Path Protection (Deny Rules)

| Category          | Pattern                                       | Blocked Tools           | Purpose                                                  | Axiom                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Claude config     | `~/.claude/*.json`                            | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Protect secrets                                          | [[data-boundaries]]          |
| Claude runtime    | `~/.claude/{hooks,skills,commands,agents}/**` | Write, Edit, Bash       | Force edits via `$AOPS/`                                 | [[skills-are-read-only]]     |
| Claude plugins    | `~/.claude/plugins/**`                        | Write, Edit             | Protect installed plugins                                | [[skills-are-read-only]]     |
| Gemini extensions | `~/.gemini/extensions/**`                     | Write, Edit             | Protect installed extensions                             | [[skills-are-read-only]]     |
| Research records  | `**/tja/records/**`, `**/tox/records/**`      | Write, Edit, Bash       | Research data immutable                                  | [[research-data-immutable]]  |
| Session state     | `/tmp/claude-session/**`                      | Write, Edit, Bash       | Protect session data                                     | Mechanical trigger integrity |
| Task indices      | `**/data/tasks/*.json`                        | Read, Bash              | Enforce MCP server usage                                 | [[just-in-time-context]]     |
| Polecat worktree  | `**` (deny) / `<worktree>/**` (allow)         | Write, Edit             | Sandbox polecat agent writes to designated worktree only | [[data-boundaries]]          |

**Note**: Reading `~/.claude/hooks/**` etc IS allowed (skill invocation needs it).

**Note**: Task JSON files (index.json, id_mapping.json) must be queried via tasks MCP server (list_tasks, search_tasks, get_task_tree, etc.) to prevent token bloat from reading large files directly.

**Note**: Claude plugins and Gemini extensions protection enforced via:

- Claude: `~/.claude/settings.json` → `permissions.deny`
- Gemini: `~/.gemini/policies/deny-extension-writes.toml` (policy engine)

## Credential Isolation (#581)

Agent must not have access to user's SSH key (which has admin/bypass rights on repos). Instead, agent uses a limited-scope fine-grained PAT.

| Mechanism                   | How                                                         | Enforcement Level |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| SSH agent blocked           | `SSH_AUTH_SOCK=""` in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`       | 6 (env override)  |
| Limited PAT for GitHub      | `AOPS_BOT_GH_TOKEN` → `GH_TOKEN` via `session_env_setup.py` | 6 (env override)  |
| No interactive auth prompts | `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`  | 6 (env override)  |

**Source files**:

- `~/.claude/settings.local.json` — env var overrides
- `aops-core/hooks/session_env_setup.py` — maps `AOPS_BOT_GH_TOKEN` → `GH_TOKEN` at session start

**PAT scope**: User-managed fine-grained PAT with limited permissions (push to non-protected branches, create PRs/issues). No admin, no bypass branch protection.

## API Validation (Tasks MCP Server)

| Rule                         | API           | Validation                                                  | Override     | Reference         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Parent task completion guard | complete_task | Reject if task has incomplete children (not done/cancelled) | `force=True` | [[aops-45392b53]] |

**Note**: Technical enforcement prevents accidental premature completion. Agents must either complete children first or explicitly override with force flag.

## Pattern Blocking (PreToolUse Hook)

| Category          | Pattern             | Blocked Tools | Purpose                    | Axiom                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Doc bloat         | `*-GUIDE.md`        | Write         | Force README consolidation | [[single-purpose-files]] |
| Doc bloat         | `.md` > 200 lines   | Write         | Force chunking             | [[self-documenting]]     |
| Git: hard reset   | `git reset --hard`  | Bash          | Preserve uncommitted work  | [[fail-fast-code]]       |
| Git: clean        | `git clean -[fd]`   | Bash          | Preserve untracked files   | [[fail-fast-code]]       |
| Git: force push   | `git push --force`  | Bash          | Protect shared history     | [[fail-fast-code]]       |
| Git: checkout all | `git checkout -- .` | Bash          | Preserve local changes     | [[fail-fast-code]]       |
| Git: stash drop   | `git stash drop`    | Bash          | Preserve stashed work      | [[fail-fast-code]]       |

## Session-End Validation (Stop Hooks)

Session end is blocked until requirements are met. Three-phase validation ensures proper handover.

### Framework Reflection Validation

**Enforcement**: `gate_registry.py` (AfterAgent → `check_agent_response_listener`) + `check_stop_gate`.

The stop gate requires reflection for session completion:

| Condition                | Gate                     | Set By                                       | Check                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| (1) Reflection validated | `handover_skill_invoked` | `check_agent_response_listener` (AfterAgent) | All required fields present |

**Note**: Reflection is required for any work that modifies files.

**Gate (2) Field Validation**: When `## Framework Reflection` is detected in agent response, all 8 required fields must be present:

| Required Field | Purpose                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Prompts**:   | Original request                  |
| **Outcome**:   | One of: success, partial, failure |

| `**Accomplishments**:` | What was completed |
| `**Friction points**:` | Issues encountered (write none if none) |
| `**Proposed changes**:` | Framework improvements (write none if none) |
| `**Next step**:` | Task IDs for follow-up work (write none if none) |

**Malformed Reflection Handling**: If `## Framework Reflection` is present but missing required fields:

- Gate remains closed (`handover_skill_invoked` NOT set)
- Warning message lists missing fields
- Context injection shows correct format
- Agent can retry with complete reflection

**Stop Gate Enforcement**: `check_stop_gate` blocks session end if any required flag is not set.

**Workflow**:

1. Agent completes work
2. Agent invokes QA skill to verify results against original request and acceptance criteria
3. PostToolUse hook sets `qa_invoked` flag
4. Agent outputs Framework Reflection with ALL required fields
5. AfterAgent hook validates format and sets `handover_skill_invoked` flag
6. Agent invokes `/dump` command
7. Agent attempts to end session (triggers Stop event)
8. Stop gate checks flags (handover, QA)
9. If flags set: session ends
10. If any flag missing: blocks with instructions for the missing step

### Uncommitted Work Check

**Enforcement**: `session_end_commit_check.py` Stop hook.

Blocks session end if:

- Framework Reflection or test success detected in transcript
- AND uncommitted changes exist in git

Auto-commits staged changes. Blocks if unstaged changes require manual commit.

## Commit-Time Validation (Pre-commit)

## Agent Tool Permissions

Main agent has all tools except deny rules. Subagents are restricted:

| Agent          | Tools Granted                                | Model  | Purpose                                                                                                        |

**Note**: `tools:` in agent frontmatter RESTRICTS available tools - it cannot GRANT access beyond what settings.json allows. Deny rules apply globally.

## Knowledge Persistence

Enforcement of [[semantic-vs-episodic-storage]] and [[current-state-machine]].

| Component              | Purpose                               | Sync to PKB          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Remember skill         | Dual-write markdown + PKB             | Yes (on invocation)  |
| Remember sync workflow | Reconcile markdown → PKB              | Yes (repair/rebuild) |
| Session-insights       | Extract and persist session learnings | Yes (Step 6.5)       |

**Markdown is SSoT** - PKB is derivative index for semantic search.

**Insight capture flow**:

- Operational findings → bd issues
- Knowledge discoveries → `activate_skill(name="remember")` → markdown + memory
- Session learnings → `/session-insights` → JSON + memory

## Task Assignment Convention

Context injected via CORE.md at SessionStart.

| Assignment      | Tag                 | Purpose                             |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Bot/agent work  | `tags: ["polecat"]` | Automated tasks for agent execution |
| Human/user work | `tags: ["human"]`   | Manual tasks requiring user action  |

**Rule**: Use tags for task assignment, not the `context` field.

**Enforcement**: Prompt-level (CORE.md). No mechanical gate.

## File Location Conventions

Context injected via CORE.md at SessionStart. Guides where agents place files.

| Content Type           | Location             | Example                                  |
