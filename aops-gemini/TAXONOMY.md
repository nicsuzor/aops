# Taxonomy: Canonical Definitions

This document is the **single authoritative source** for all framework concepts. Every other document in the framework MUST use these terms consistently. When in doubt, this document wins.

## The Hierarchy

```
GOAL (multi-month/year desired outcome)
  └─ PROJECT (coherent body of work toward a goal)
      └─ EPIC (PR-sized unit of verifiable work)
          └─ TASK (discrete deliverable within an epic)
              └─ ACTION (single-session step within a task)
```

Every node has exactly one parent. Goals are roots. Tasks never float free — they always belong to an epic.

## The Orchestration Layer

```
WORKFLOW (composable step arrangement for achieving an epic)
  └─ STEP (one unit of work within a workflow)
      └─ SKILL (fungible instructions for HOW to execute a step)
          └─ PROCEDURE (skill-internal instructions, not fungible)
```

Workflows define WHAT to do and in WHAT order. Skills define HOW to do a single step. Skills are fungible — you can swap one for another that does the same thing. Procedures are skill-internal details that only make sense within that skill.

## Concept Definitions

### Goal

A desired future state, typically multi-month or multi-year in scope. Goals are directional — they describe where you want to be, not exactly how to get there. A goal may be vague and is expected to evolve.

**Examples**: "Transform academicOps into autonomous academic research engine", "World-class academic profile"

**Children**: Projects

**Anti-pattern**: A goal with tasks directly underneath. If you can do it in a session, it's not a goal.

### Project

A **noun** — a discrete, specific thing we work on. A project has a defined scope, clear boundaries, and produces tangible outputs. Projects are ongoing — they can run for weeks or months. You should be able to point to what the thing IS.

**Examples**: "AcademicOps", "OSB Political Speech Benchmarking", "TJA", "Network Planning"

**Children**: Epics (and sub-projects, rarely)

**Anti-pattern**: A project with direct task children. Tasks belong to epics, not projects.

**Anti-pattern**: A "project" that is really a category — a grab-bag of unrelated work. "Explorations" or "Misc" are categories, not projects. If children serve different aims, they belong to different projects.

### Epic

A **verb** — a bundle of related work that together achieves an aim within a project. An epic is PR-sized: a coherent set of changes that can be reviewed, tested, and merged together. An epic is complete when all of its workflow steps pass — planning, execution, and verification.

An epic includes:

1. **Planning tasks**: Methodology, acceptance criteria, approach design
2. **Execution tasks**: The actual work
3. **Verification tasks**: Testing, QA, cross-referencing, review

In the Bazaar model, different agents may handle different tasks within an epic. The quality guarantee comes from the workflow structure — if every required step is verifiably complete, the epic is good. A failure at any step fails the entire epic until fixed or abandoned.

**Typical scope**: 5–20 hours across multiple sessions. Multiple distinct deliverables. Results in one PR or one reviewable unit.

**Children**: Tasks, bugs, features

**Anti-pattern**: An epic that is really a project (months of work, dozens of tasks). If it needs more than ~12 child tasks, decompose into sub-epics or reclassify as a project.

**Anti-pattern**: An epic with no verification tasks. Every epic must include at least one QA/review step to be considered verifiable.

### Task

A discrete deliverable within an epic. A task can be completed in a single focused session (1–4 hours) and produces a specific, identifiable output.

**Examples**: "Write acceptance criteria for dashboard", "Implement sort function", "Run regression tests"

**Parent**: Always an epic

**Children**: Actions (optional, for multi-step tasks)

**Anti-pattern**: An orphan task with no epic parent. Find or create the epic first.

**Anti-pattern**: A task that takes multiple sessions. That's an epic, not a task.

### Action

A single work step within a task, completable in under 30 minutes. Actions are optional — not every task needs to be decomposed into actions.

**Examples**: "Add import statement", "Run test suite", "Update config file"

### Bug, Feature

Specialised task types that follow the same rules as tasks but carry semantic meaning about what kind of work they represent.

### Learn

Observational tracking — not actionable work, but a record of something discovered or noted. Learns can be attached at any level.

## Orchestration Concepts

### Workflow

A **brief, composable arrangement of steps** that describes how to achieve an epic. A workflow answers "WHAT do we do and in WHAT order?" — not "HOW do we do each step."

Workflows are the Bazaar's quality guarantee. By defining required steps (including verification), workflows ensure that work is good enough regardless of which agent performs it. You don't need to micromanage agents if the workflow structure mandates planning before execution and verification after.

**Structure**: A workflow is a sequence of steps, each of which may invoke a base workflow pattern and require a specific skill. Workflows compose base patterns (task-tracking, tdd, verification, commit, handover, etc.) into coherent processes.

**Examples**: `feature-dev` (plan → test → implement → verify → commit), `decompose` (understand → identify stages → draft tasks → verify coverage)

**Anti-pattern**: A workflow that contains detailed HOW-TO instructions. That's a skill, not a workflow.

**Anti-pattern**: A workflow embedded inside a skill file. Workflows are orchestration; skills are execution. A skill never contains a workflow (see Principle #0 in workflow-system-spec).

### Step

One unit within a workflow. A step has a clear purpose, an expected output, and may specify which skill an agent needs to execute it.

**Examples**: "Write acceptance criteria" (step in a feature-dev workflow, uses QA skill), "Run regression tests" (step in verification workflow, uses testing skill)

### Skill

Instructions to an individual agent about **HOW to achieve a workflow step**. A skill is domain expertise packaged as a document: what tools to use, what quality criteria to meet, what patterns to follow, what anti-patterns to avoid.

**Skills are fungible.** You could use the Outlook email skill or the Gmail email skill to achieve the workflow step "check my email" — it doesn't matter which. This is what enables the Bazaar model: a workflow defines the required steps, and any agent with a skill that satisfies the step can fill the slot. Users can swap skills in and out without changing the workflow.

**Structure**: A skill document contains the domain expertise needed for one type of work. It may include **procedures** — detailed internal instructions for HOW this particular skill accomplishes its tasks. But it should NOT contain workflows (general orchestration that could be achieved by a different skill).

**Examples**: `python-dev` (how to write production-quality Python), `qa` (how to verify work meets criteria), `pdf` (how to create formatted PDFs)

**Anti-pattern**: A skill with an embedded workflow router ("If you need to do X, use workflow A; if Y, use workflow B"). That routing belongs in WORKFLOWS.md, not in a skill file.

### Procedure

A **skill-internal instruction** that describes HOW a specific skill accomplishes a task. Procedures are tightly coupled to their skill — they only make sense in the context of that skill's tools, conventions, and domain knowledge. Unlike workflows, procedures are NOT fungible: you can't swap in a different skill to follow the same procedure.

**Location**: `skills/{name}/procedures/*.md` (NOT `workflows/` — that name is reserved for general orchestration).

**Examples**: `remember/procedures/capture.md` (how the remember skill captures knowledge), `framework/procedures/01-design-new-component.md` (how to add a new component to this specific framework)

**Test**: Could a different skill achieve the same outcome by following these instructions? If yes, it's a workflow (move to global `workflows/`). If no (the instructions are meaningless outside this skill), it's a procedure.

## Key Principles

### 1. Every task belongs to an epic

No orphan tasks. If a task exists, there must be an epic that gives it purpose and context. If you can't identify the epic, create one — even a lightweight one — before creating the task.

### 2. Epics are PR-sized and verifiable

An epic is not an arbitrary container. It's sized for review: small enough to understand in one sitting, large enough to be a meaningful unit of progress. It includes its own verification steps.

### 3. Workflows orchestrate; skills execute; skills are fungible

Workflows define WHAT steps to take and in WHAT order. Skills define HOW to execute a step. A workflow may reference multiple skills. A skill NEVER contains a workflow — it may contain procedures (skill-internal HOW-TO), but not orchestration (general WHAT-TO-DO). Skills are fungible: a workflow step like "check email" can be satisfied by any email skill (Outlook, Gmail, etc.). This separation is what makes the Bazaar model work — workflows guarantee quality through structure, and any agent with the right skill can fill each slot.

### 4. The hierarchy provides context

Each level of the hierarchy answers "why?" in terms of its parent. A task's purpose is explained by its epic. An epic's purpose is explained by its project. A project's purpose is explained by its goal. If you can't trace this chain, something is misplaced.

### 5. Failure propagates up within an epic

In the Bazaar model, a failure at any workflow step (a failed test, a rejected review, an inadequate plan) fails the entire epic. This is by design — it's how we achieve quality without micromanaging agents. The epic isn't done until all required steps verifiably pass.

## Relationships Between Concepts

```
HIERARCHY                          ORCHESTRATION
─────────                          ─────────────
Goal                               Workflow
 └─ Project                         ├─ Step 1 → Skill A
     └─ Epic ◄──── achieved by ────►├─ Step 2 → Skill B
         ├─ Task                    ├─ Step 3 → Skill A
         ├─ Task                    └─ Step 4 → Skill C
         └─ Task
```

An epic is achieved by executing a workflow. The workflow's steps correspond to (but are not identical to) the epic's child tasks. The workflow defines the required sequence; the tasks are the concrete work items created to fulfill each step.
