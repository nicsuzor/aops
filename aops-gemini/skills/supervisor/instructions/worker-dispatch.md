# Worker Dispatch

Supervisor dispatches individual tasks to workers. This phase transforms
approved decomposition into execution — one task at a time.

---

## Worker Types and Capabilities

> **Configuration**: See [[WORKERS.md]] for current worker types, capabilities,
> cost/speed profiles, and capacity limits. Modify that file to add workers or
> change profiles without editing this skill.

Load worker registry before dispatch. Each worker has:

- **Capabilities**: What task types it can handle
- **Cost/Speed**: Resource trade-offs (1-5 scale)
- **Max Concurrent**: Capacity limit for parallel dispatch
- **Best For**: Recommended use cases

---

## Pre-Dispatch Validation (MANDATORY)

Before dispatching ANY task to a worker, the supervisor must validate:

1. **PKB consistency**: The task exists, with matching content, in all three places the worker's bootstrap will consult:
   - Local disk (`ls $ACA_DATA/tasks/task-<id>*`)
   - Local CLI index (`pkb show task-<id>`)
   - Remote PKB MCP (`get_task` via MCP)

   After a fresh `git pull`, the MCP can lag by minutes. If MCP returns "Task not found" while disk and CLI see it, **do not dispatch**. Polecat will claim the task, its bootstrap will fail the MCP lookup, and the worker will exit leaving the task stuck in `in_progress` with no worktree. Wait for MCP to catch up, then re-check.

2. **Target currency**: Are the files/modules the task will touch still current? Check for:
   - Deprecated code (superseded by another implementation, possibly in a different repo)
   - Files that no longer exist on the default branch
   - Components that have been rewritten or moved

3. **Repo correctness**: Does the task belong in this repository? Check the task body and AC for references to other repos. If the task's deliverable lives elsewhere, redirect it — don't dispatch.

4. **AC implementability**: Can the acceptance criteria be met with the current codebase? If AC references APIs, tools, or patterns that no longer exist, the task needs updating before dispatch.

**If validation fails**: Update the task with findings, set status to `blocked`, and skip it. Do NOT dispatch tasks that will produce wasted work.

**Recovery from a stuck claim**: If a polecat claimed a task but exited before spawning a worktree (no entry in `polecat list`, no directory under `$POLECAT_HOME/worktrees/`, but task shows `status: in_progress` with `assignee: polecat`): run `polecat reset-stalled --hours 0 --force`, then re-dispatch once pre-dispatch validation passes.

**Why this matters**: Without runtime hydration (gate is off), this pre-dispatch check is the last opportunity to catch tasks aimed at deprecated code. The 2026-03-22 dogfood run lost a full worker cycle to a task targeting superseded Python files (GH #224). The 2026-04-20 dogfood run lost a claim cycle to MCP/disk divergence.

## Critic Gate for High-Blast-Radius Tasks

Some tasks carry risk of irreversible harm: OTA firmware updates, production
deployments, data migrations, file deletions at scale, uploads to external
systems. These require independent review of the task spec BEFORE dispatch —
the entity that executes must not be the same entity that decides whether
to execute.

### When the Critic Gate Applies

A task requires critic-gated dispatch if ANY of:

- Task is tagged `high-risk`, `irreversible`, `production`, or `destructive`
- Task body mentions keywords like: OTA, flash, deploy, migrate, delete (at scale), upload to external system — these are **heuristic indicators**, not an exhaustive list
- Task modifies infrastructure (CI/CD workflows, deployment configs, DNS)
- Task targets a remote/physical system where failure requires physical intervention to recover
- **Supervisor judgment** (authoritative): the action closes a recovery path, affects systems beyond version control, or has blast radius disproportionate to the task scope

Supervisor judgment is the primary trigger. Tag matching and keyword heuristics are a defense-in-depth safety net for tasks that weren't tagged during decomposition — they catch what judgment might miss, but they don't replace it.

### Gate Protocol

1. **Prepare dispatch review context**:

   ```markdown
   # Dispatch Review: <task-id>

   ## Task Spec

   [Full task body including AC]

   ## Target State

   [Current state of files/systems the task will modify — verified, not inferred]

   ## Blast Radius

   - What changes: [files, systems, devices]
   - Reversibility: [automatic | manual-remote | manual-physical | irreversible]
   - Failure impact: [what happens if the task goes wrong]
   - Recovery paths before action: [list every way to access/fix the target]
   - Recovery paths after action (if it fails): [which paths survive?]

   ## Rollback Plan

   [See below — required for all critic-gated tasks]
   ```

2. **Invoke Pauli** (mandatory for all critic-gated tasks):

   Use the `aops-core:pauli` agent with the dispatch review context. Focus:
   - Is the task spec complete enough to execute safely?
   - Are preconditions verified from evidence, not inferred?
   - Does the action close any recovery path?
   - Are edge cases handled?

   Verdict: `SAFE_TO_DISPATCH` / `NEEDS_REFINEMENT` / `DO_NOT_DISPATCH`

   **Batch review**: When an epic has multiple `high-risk` tasks that share
   context (same target system, same blast radius class), batch them into a
   single Pauli invocation. Include all task specs in one dispatch review
   context. This avoids redundant reviews while maintaining coverage.

3. **Gate decision**:

   | Pauli Verdict    | Result                                               |
   | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
   | SAFE_TO_DISPATCH | Dispatch normally                                    |
   | NEEDS_REFINEMENT | Return to task spec refinement, do NOT dispatch      |
   | DO_NOT_DISPATCH  | Set task to `review`, escalate to human with context |

4. **Record gate result** in the task body (the task file is the only state store — see SKILL.md design principles):
   ```
   [timestamp] CRITIC GATE: Pauli: SAFE_TO_DISPATCH → dispatching
   [timestamp] CRITIC GATE: Pauli: DO_NOT_DISPATCH (closes only network ingress) → review
   ```

5. **Human override** (for `DO_NOT_DISPATCH` or `NEEDS_REFINEMENT` verdicts):

   The critic gate is a safety check, not a permanent block. If a human
   determines the task is safe despite the verdict, they can override:

   - Set the task status back to `queued` in PKB
   - Append a note: `CRITIC OVERRIDE: <rationale for why this is safe>`
   - The supervisor dispatches on the next cycle without re-invoking the gate

   The override rationale is recorded in the task body for audit. The
   supervisor does NOT override on its own — only humans can.

### Rollback Plan Requirements

Every critic-gated task MUST include a Rollback Plan in the task body before
dispatch. The supervisor adds this during DECOMPOSE or before DISPATCH.

**Required format** (appended to task body):

```markdown
## Rollback Plan

**Reversibility**: [automatic | manual-remote | manual-physical | irreversible]

### Steps to Revert

1. [Specific command or action to undo the change]
2. [Verification that revert succeeded]

### Preconditions for Safe Rollback

- [What must be true for rollback to work]
- [Time window: must revert within X minutes/hours?]

### If Rollback Fails

- [Contingency if revert steps don't work]
- [Escalation path]
```

**Dispatch rules based on reversibility**:

| Reversibility   | Dispatch allowed? | Additional requirement                          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| automatic       | Yes               | Rollback steps must be executable by agent      |
| manual-remote   | Yes               | Human must be reachable (not overnight/weekend) |
| manual-physical | NO — refuse       | Escalate to human with full context             |
| irreversible    | NO — refuse       | Set `review`, present alternatives to human     |

**Refusal grounds** (from issue #454 — any one is sufficient to refuse):

- Rollback requires physical intervention
- Action closes the only recovery path
- Preconditions are inferred, not verified from evidence
- Success criteria are vague or untestable
- Failure detection has no out-of-band evidence path

**Rollback plan validation**: Before accepting a rollback plan, check: does
every external system modified by the task have a corresponding revert step?
If the rollback plan only addresses version control (e.g., `git revert`) but
the task modifies external systems, the plan is incomplete. Git revert undoes
the code change — it doesn't un-flash a device or un-deploy a service.

## Worker Selection

**Step 1: Assess Task Requirements**

Extract required capabilities from task metadata:

```markdown
## Task Analysis for Worker Selection

**Task**: <task-id>
**Tags**: [list from task.tags]
**Complexity**: <task.complexity or inferred>
**Files affected**: <count from decomposition>
**Estimated effort**: <from decomposition>

### Required Capabilities

[Map task characteristics to capabilities]

### Constraints

- Deadline pressure: [yes/no]
- Budget sensitivity: [yes/no]
- Quality criticality: [low/medium/high]
```

**Step 2: Apply Selection Rules**

> **Configuration**: Selection rules (tag routing, complexity routing, heuristic
> thresholds) are defined in [[WORKERS.md]]. Modify that file to change routing
> behavior.

Apply rules in priority order:

1. **Complexity routing**: Match task.complexity against Complexity Routing table
2. **Tag routing**: Check task.tags against High-Stakes and Bulk tag lists
3. **Heuristic thresholds**: Apply file count and effort rules
4. **Default**: Use configured default worker (typically claude for safety)

**Step 3: Check Capacity**

Before dispatch, verify worker availability against limits in [[WORKERS.md]].

1. Load Max Concurrent for selected worker type from WORKERS.md
2. Count in_progress tasks assigned to that worker type
3. If at capacity:
   - Try fallback worker if task capabilities permit
   - Otherwise queue task for later dispatch

---

## Dispatch Protocol

**Single Task Dispatch**:

```bash
# Claude worker for a specific task (by task ID)
polecat run -t <task-id> -p <project>

# Gemini worker for a specific task
polecat run -t <task-id> -p <project> --gemini

# Claude worker claiming next ready task from queue
polecat run -p <project>

# Gemini worker claiming next ready task from queue
polecat run -g -p <project>

# Jules (asynchronous, runs on Google infrastructure)
aops task <task-id> | jules new --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

**Jules Dispatch Notes**:

- Pipe task context from `aops task` into `jules new` — this gives Jules the full task body, relationships, and acceptance criteria
- Jules sessions are asynchronous — returns a session URL immediately
- Check status: `jules remote list --session`
- One session per task
- Sessions show "Completed" when coding is done but require human approval on Jules web UI before branches are pushed and PRs are created

### Coordinated Branch Dispatch

For tightly coupled subtasks (3+ tasks modifying overlapping files or
contributing to a single logical feature), the supervisor can coordinate
multiple polecats onto a shared feature branch instead of individual
`polecat/<task-id>` branches.

**When to use**: Decide during DECOMPOSE, not DISPATCH. Use when:

- 3+ subtasks modify the same files
- Tasks contribute to a single logical feature that makes more sense as one PR
- Individual PRs would create a chain of merge conflicts

**Setup** (supervisor does this before dispatching any worker):

1. Create feature branch: `git fetch origin && git checkout -b feature/<epic-id> origin/main && git push -u origin feature/<epic-id>`
2. Create draft PR: `gh pr create --draft --title "<epic title>" --body "<summary>\n\nTracks <epic-id>" --base main --head feature/<epic-id>`
3. Record in the epic's Supervisor State block: `**Feature Branch**: feature/<epic-id> (PR #NNN, draft)`

**Worker instructions** (add to each subtask body):

```markdown
## Branch Instructions

Push commits to branch `feature/<epic-id>` (already exists on remote).
Do NOT create a new branch. Pull before pushing:
git pull origin feature/<epic-id>
Do NOT file a separate PR — work contributes to draft PR #NNN.
Call `mcp_pkb_release_task` with branch="feature/<epic-id>" when done.
```

**Sequencing**: Dispatch one polecat at a time to the shared branch.
Record "branch lock: task-abc" in the epic task body. Next polecat dispatches
only after the current one releases its task.

**Completion**: When all subtasks are done, mark draft PR ready:
`gh pr ready <PR-number>`. The normal review pipeline takes over.

**Fallback**: If a polecat fails to push (conflict, etc.), fall back to
individual-branch mode for remaining tasks. Merge those branches into the
feature branch manually before marking the PR ready.

**Deadlock prevention**: If the branch-locked worker hangs (no `release_task`,
no PR activity), `polecat reset-stalled --hours 4` will reset it to `queued`,
implicitly releasing the branch lock. The supervisor dispatches the next
waiting `queued` sibling on its next ORIENT pass. If coordinated dispatch is
producing repeated conflicts or failures, abort coordinated mode: dispatch
remaining tasks on individual `polecat/<task-id>` branches and merge them into
the feature branch before marking the PR ready.

---

**Dispatch Recording** (in epic task body, BEFORE firing the worker):

Update the work items table with status `in_progress`, the worker type, and
the dispatch timestamp. The supervisor checks status on next orient phase.

```markdown
### Activity Log

[ISO timestamp] [environment]: Dispatched task-abc to claude via polecat run
```

---

## Post-Dispatch

After dispatch, update the work items table in the epic task body. The
supervisor checks status on its next invocation (orient phase) — it does
not actively poll.

**Stale task cleanup** (periodic, not real-time):

```bash
# Reset tasks stuck in_progress for >4 hours (cron or manual)
polecat reset-stalled --hours 4 --dry-run
polecat reset-stalled --hours 4
```

This is a janitorial operation. Run it periodically (e.g., via `stale-check`
cron hook) to clean up crashed workers.

**Expected worker communication**: Workers call `mcp_pkb_release_task` upon
finishing, which updates task status and appends structured notes to the task
body. The supervisor should not assume silence means success — always verify
via PKB query and GitHub PR check during MONITOR phase.

**Worker failures surface as missing PRs.** If a worker fails, no PR appears.
The task stays `in_progress` until the stale-check resets it to `queued` for
the next dispatch cycle.

**Known issue: auto-finish override loop.** When a task was already completed
by another worker (e.g., Jules fixed it), polecat auto-finish detects zero
changes and resets to queued, creating an infinite retry loop. Workaround:
mark the task `done` manually. See `aops-fdc9d0e2`.

---

## Remote Dispatch via SSH + tmux

When the supervisor is running on a different machine from the polecat host
(e.g., running `/supervisor` on a laptop while polecats execute on a remote
host), use SSH + tmux so workers survive network interruptions (lid close,
VPN drop, etc.).

### Environment Discovery

Before dispatching, verify the remote machine is ready:

```bash
# SSH connectivity
ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 TARGET_HOST "echo connected"

# Polecat availability (alias loaded in interactive zsh)
ssh TARGET_HOST "zsh -i -c 'polecat --help'" 2>&1

# tmux availability
ssh TARGET_HOST "which tmux"
```

If any check fails, report the failure and stop. Do not improvise alternatives.

**Reachability pre-check for incident tasks**: If a task requires the worker
to SSH into a _third_ machine (e.g., `services-new` from `TARGET_HOST`), verify
that hop before dispatch:

```bash
ssh TARGET_HOST "ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 REMOTE_TARGET 'echo reachable'" 2>&1
```

If unreachable, set the task to `blocked` with the reason and skip it. Do not
dispatch a worker that cannot reach its target.

### Dispatch

For each task, SSH into the target host and create a named tmux session:

```bash
ssh TARGET_HOST "tmux new-session -d -s 'polecat-TASKID' 'zsh -i -c \"polecat run -t TASKID -p PROJECT\"'"
```

The `zsh -i -c` wrapping ensures the polecat alias is available regardless of
tmux's default-shell setting.

**Verify sessions are running** after dispatch:

```bash
ssh TARGET_HOST "tmux has-session -t 'polecat-TASKID' && echo \"Session 'polecat-TASKID' is running\""
```

Session existence is the primary verification signal. A synchronous headless
supervisor cannot poll pane output — accept session existence as sufficient.

**Append a dispatch log** to each task body via PKB, then **read back** to
confirm the append landed (MCP append tools can silently fail):

```
[ISO timestamp] TARGET_HOST: Dispatched to polecat via SSH+tmux session 'polecat-TASKID'
```

### Ground Rules

1. **Do NOT monitor or poll.** Dispatch, verify sessions started, and report.
2. **If SSH fails**, report immediately. Retry once at most.
3. **If tmux session already exists** with that name, check if it's running a
   polecat. If yes, report and skip. Do not create a duplicate.
4. **Do NOT modify task status.** Polecat handles status transitions.
5. **Critic gate still applies.** HIGH-risk tasks must pass the gate (above)
   before SSH dispatch. The gate runs locally; dispatch is the last step.
6. **Report operational observations.** Repo drift, required rebases, stale
   mirrors, unexpected startup errors — include these in the dispatch report.

### Report Format

```markdown
## Remote Dispatch Report — TARGET_HOST

### [task-id] ([short title])

- **Critic gate**: [verdict + 1-sentence reasoning] (or N/A for normal-risk)
- **Reachability**: [verified / not applicable / FAILED]
- **tmux session**: [created / already_existed / failed]
- **Session verified**: [yes — via tmux has-session (confirmed by success message)]
- **PKB log confirmed**: [yes — read-back verified / no — append may have failed]

### Environment Observations

[Anything noteworthy: repo drift, rebase required, stale state, access issues]
```

### Example

```bash
# Typical dispatch to a remote host (e.g., via SSH+tmux)
ssh TARGET_HOST "tmux new-session -d -s 'polecat-task-abc12345' 'zsh -i -c \"polecat run -t task-abc12345 -p brain\"'"
ssh TARGET_HOST "tmux has-session -t 'polecat-task-abc12345' && echo \"Session 'polecat-task-abc12345' is running\""
```

## Parallel Execution Coordination

Workers coordinate through the task system, not through the supervisor:

**Dependency Respect**:

- Workers only claim tasks with satisfied `depends_on`
- Polecat CLI `claim_next_task()` in `manager.py` enforces this via atomic file locking
- No supervisor verification needed at runtime

**Conflict Prevention**:

- Each polecat worker operates in isolated worktree
- No two workers touch same task (atomic claiming)
- Jules sessions are isolated by design (separate Google infrastructure)
- If decomposition reveals shared files:
  - Add explicit `depends_on` between subtasks before dispatch

---

## Parallel Dispatch into a Shared Repo

When dispatching multiple general-purpose subagents (not polecat workers) at
once into the same underlying repo — e.g. via the Task tool with
`isolation: worktree` — the nominal isolation is **not sufficient**. Agents
still race on the shared checkout: one `git checkout -b` while another is
mid-commit lands commits on the wrong branch. Every parallel dispatch must
follow this pattern.

### Mandatory per-agent setup

Each agent's brief MUST instruct it to create its own private worktree
**before** any work, and remove it at the end:

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add /tmp/wt-<task-id> -b <branch-name> origin/<base-branch>
cd /tmp/wt-<task-id>
# ... do work ...
# on exit: git worktree remove /tmp/wt-<task-id>
```

Never let two agents share a checkout. `isolation: worktree` alone is not
enough — make the private worktree explicit in the brief.

### Mandatory push pattern

`branch.autoSetupMerge=always` is common on aops machines, so
`git checkout -b feature origin/main` sets the new branch's upstream to
`origin/main`. A plain `git push -u origin <branch>` then tries to push to
`refs/heads/main` and is rejected by branch protection. Always use an
explicit refspec:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>:<branch>
```

### No-touch lists

When dispatching N parallel agents into one repo, compute each agent's
**no-touch list** = every file or path any other agent is expected to touch,
plus any in-flight dirty changes. Include the list verbatim in the brief.
Without it, agents improvise (stash unrelated changes, edit adjacent files)
and integration becomes unrecoverable.

### Required report shape from each agent

Every parallel-dispatched agent must return a structured report as its final
deliverable. The integration step depends on this shape — free-form prose
makes bundled merges unsafe:

```markdown
- **Branch**: <branch-name>
- **Commits**: <SHA1>, <SHA2>, ...
- **Files touched**: <list>
- **Files NOT touched** (from no-touch list): confirmed
- **Deviations from brief**: <none | list>
- **Deferred verification**: <none | list of unrunnable tests with reproduce steps>
```

The supervisor uses this directly to assemble a bundle branch and to file
follow-up verification tasks (see [[supervision-loop]] MONITOR).
