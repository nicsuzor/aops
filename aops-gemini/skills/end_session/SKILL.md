# /dump: session close and handover

Close a work session cleanly: commit, push, file a PR, record the structured session fields on the task, emit a terse handover block for the terminal, halt.

This skill is used as the normal end-of-session path. It is also used for special-case handovers (emergency, cross-machine / cross-environment / cross-project transfer, interrupted session needing full context capture).

## Contract

Per [[session-handover-contract]]:

- Terminal output is a terse 5–10 line markdown block in a strict parseable format.
- Structured session data lives in the task's YAML frontmatter, written by `release_task`.
- `$AOPS_SESSION_ID` is the join key that groups session artifacts.

## Execution

1. **Commit, push, file PR**. If file changes exist, commit them, push the branch, and run `gh pr create --fill`. If no file changes, skip. Never end a session with uncommitted work.

2. **Call `release_task` once, with the full session payload.**

   ```
   mcp_pkb_release_task(
     id="<task-id>",
     status="merge_ready" | "review" | "done" | "blocked",
     session_id="$AOPS_SESSION_ID",
     pr_url="https://github.com/...",         # omit if no PR
     branch="<branch-name>",
     issue_url="https://github.com/.../issues/...",  # omit if none
     follow_up_tasks=["task-xxxx", "task-yyyy"],     # task IDs only; must exist
     release_summary="<one sentence, result-oriented, <= 500 chars>"
   )
   ```

   - **No task bound?** `release_task` auto-creates a minimal ad-hoc task under the `adhoc-sessions` root ([[T4]]). Until T4 lands, fall back to `create_task` first, then `release_task` on the new id.
   - **`release_summary` quality**: result-oriented ("Implemented YAML schema extension for session handover"), not activity-oriented ("I worked on the schema"). This is the primary signal for the Recent Sessions dashboard.
   - **Follow-ups**: every concrete future action must be a real PKB task before you list it here. Do not put bullet prose into `release_summary` or session notes — the dashboard and `/recap` only see structured fields.
   - **Fallback**: if `release_task` is unavailable, `update_task(id=..., status="merge_ready")` keeps the supervisor unblocked, but the dashboard loses this session.
   - **Polecat note**: calling `release_task` with a terminal status is what lets the polecat supervisor detect termination via PKB polling. Skipping this leaves Gemini workers running until external timeout (#521).

3. **Emit the handover block**. Exactly this shape, 5–10 lines:

   ```markdown
   ### Session Handover

   - **Session ID**: `$AOPS_SESSION_ID`
   - **Primary Task**: `<task-id>` (<short title>)
   - **PR**: <url>
   - **Branch**: `<branch>`
   - **Issue**: <url or "none">
   - **Follow-ups**: `<task-id>`, `<task-id>` (or "none")
   - **Summary**: <release_summary value>
   ```

   Omit `PR` and `Issue` lines if not set. Omit `Follow-ups` if empty. Do not add any prose before or after the block.

4. **Halt.** Nothing follows the handover block.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does **not** persist discoveries to memory, codify learnings, or file GitHub issues. Those are separate skills ([[remember]], [[learn]]) and belong in the session body, not the close.
- Does **not** loop on itself. If the gate reopens after further edits, run `end_session` again.
