# Skills Index

Quick reference for routing user requests to skills/commands. When a request matches triggers below, use direct routing and invoke.

## Skills and Commands

| Skill               | Type    | Triggers                                                                                                                                                                                                | Modifies Files | Needs Task | Mode           | Domain                        | Description                                                                                 |

## Routing Rules

1. **Explicit match**: User says "/daily" or "update my daily" -> invoke `/daily` directly
2. **Trigger match**: User request matches trigger phrases -> suggest skill, confirm if ambiguous
3. **Context match**: File types or project structure indicate skill -> apply skill guidance
4. **No match**: Route through normal workflow selection (WORKFLOWS.md)
