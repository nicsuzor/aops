# Diagram

Mermaid and Excalidraw diagramming standards, layout routing, and visual invariants.

## Objective and layout routing

Identify the chart's core objective (the action or decision it enables) and reader context before drawing.

| Reader question          | Layout family         | Guidance                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "What do I do next?"     | Containment + state   | Group by navigation paths; emphasize active items. |
| "How does this work?"    | Flow / sequence       | Directional arrows; default to Mermaid.            |
| "Where does this fit?"   | Containment / nesting | Boundary nesting up to ~3 levels deep.             |
| "How do these compare?"  | Matrix / grid         | Uniform grid with comparable cells.                |
| "What changed / is off?" | Anomaly / comparison  | Highlight outliers without data smoothing.         |
| "When does this happen?" | Timeline              | Position strictly encodes chronological time.      |
| "What is central here?"  | Radial / hub          | Focal node centered with balanced spokes.          |

### Visual channel rules

- **Bind channels to real fields**: Derive weights, status, and structure from source data -- never author arbitrary hierarchies.
- **One channel, one meaning**: Document encodings in a legend; unassigned channels remain uniform.
- **Explicit omission**: Label truncated containers (e.g., "showing 3 of 12"); never invent category names for unselected items.
- **Respect live files**: When editing an open diagram, diff against mtime/disk state to preserve external user edits.

## Craft rules

- **Single message**: One primary argument per chart; sub-processes get dedicated diagrams.
- **Chunking**: Limit clusters to 6--9 nodes; align happy path along a straight spine.
- **Labels**: Terse, verb-first labels (3--9 words). State current facts, not change logs or historical commentary.
- **Shapes**: Process (rectangles), decision (diamonds), terminal/actors (circles), mind maps (ellipses).

## Mermaid conventions

- **Default orientation**: Use `LR`. Use `TD` only for wide fan-outs. In subgraphs, use `direction TB`.
- **Subgraphs**: Link subgraph to subgraph, not internal nodes to external nodes.
- **Scale**: Past ~15 nodes or heavy cross-links, switch to ELK (`layout: elk`, `mergeEdges: true`, `nodePlacementStrategy: SIMPLE`).
- **Phases**: Group 10+ steps into numbered phases (① ② ③) colored start (green) -> work (gold) -> end (gray).

## Excalidraw conventions

### Aesthetic defaults

| Property      | Value             | Rationale                      |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `roughness`   | `2`               | Sketch aesthetic               |
| `fontFamily`  | `1` (Virgil)      | Hand-drawn typeface            |
| `fillStyle`   | `"hachure"`       | Sketch hatching                |
| `strokeStyle` | `"solid"`         | Consistent hand-drawn stroke   |
| Background    | White (`#ffffff`) | High contrast and printability |

### Layered composition

1. **Scenery**: Zones and boundaries (`--preset zone`).
2. **Spine**: Focal landmarks and critical paths (`--preset hero`).
3. **Satellites**: Standard operational nodes.
4. **Annotations**: Contextual commentary (`--preset sticky`).
5. **Connectors**: Solid flows or dashed telemetry (`--curved`, `--stroke-style dashed`).

### CLI tools and invariants

`pkb-excalidraw` is the preferred way to read and edit `.excalidraw` files; use it before reading or writing the JSON directly, because its mutations refuse to save a file that fails validation. Run `pkb-excalidraw --help` for the full command set.

```bash
pkb-excalidraw FILE [summary | map | nodes | edges | style | check | overlap | arrows-check]
pkb-excalidraw FILE add-node --type <type> --text "<text>" [--preset hero|sticky|zone] [--at X,Y]
pkb-excalidraw FILE connect --from <id1> --to <id2> [--label "<label>"] [--curved] [--stroke-style dashed]
pkb-excalidraw FILE [set-text <id> "<text>" | fit <id> "<text>" | move-elem <id> --by DX,DY | delete-elem <id>]
pkb-excalidraw FILE update <id> --set '{"strokeStyle": "dashed"}'
```

- **Invariants**: Text binds to container (`containerId`/`boundElements`); arrows bind both ends (`startBinding`/`endBinding`).
- Change text with `set-text` or `fit`, which update `text` and `originalText` together. Change any other property with `update <id> --set '<json>'`.
- Validate after every edit with `pkb-excalidraw FILE check` and `pkb-excalidraw FILE overlap`. `check` does not flag line-wrap-only differences between `text` and `originalText`.

### Editing an existing diagram

When the diagram already exists and the ask changes the plan or state it shows, edit the existing elements in place so the delta is visible on the canvas:

- **Moved** thing: `move-elem` the existing element.
- **Renamed** thing: `set-text` or `fit` the existing element.
- **Changed status**: set `strokeColor`/`backgroundColor` on the existing element to the palette role for its new state.
- **Removed** thing: `delete-elem` it, and its bound text and arrows.
- **Genuinely new** thing: `add-node` only for this.

Keep the `id` of every surviving element. `pkb excalidraw diff` and `sync` match canvas elements to PKB nodes by `id`; a replaced element reads as a deletion plus an unrelated addition.

**Anti-pattern -- the parallel system.** Do not draw a fresh set of elements beside the old ones to depict the new state. It leaves two contradictory versions on one canvas, hides what changed, and severs every `id` binding. Before adding any element, check whether an existing element already represents that thing; if one does, edit it.

### PKB export and sync

```bash
pkb excalidraw export <output_path> [--focus <node_id>] [--hops <H>]
pkb excalidraw diff <canvas_path> [--base <snapshot>] [--json]
pkb excalidraw sync <canvas_path> [--base <snapshot>] [--dry-run]
```

Reconcile user canvas edits with `diff` and `sync` back to markdown frontmatter rather than clobbering.

## Palette

| Role               | Hex                      | Role               | Hex                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Emphasis / headers | `#c9b458` (gold)         | Error / blocked    | `#ff6666` (soft red)     |
| Success / active   | `#8fbc8f` (soft green)   | Text / labels      | `#1a1a1a` (primary dark) |
| Active accent      | `#76c893` (bright green) | De-emphasized text | `#888888` (muted)        |
| Info / links       | `#7a9fbf` (soft blue)    | Borders / arrows   | `#404040` (charcoal)     |
| Warning / queued   | `#ffa500` (orange)       | Completed fills    | `#252525` (surface)      |

- Maximum 4--6 colors per diagram.
- Opacity: 10--35% for fills with `#1a1a1a` text; 4.5:1 minimum contrast.
