    ``REFUSE`` denies a tool call outright and is reserved for structural

    rule verdict.

    ``BLOCK`` refuses to let a *stop* land: the turn continues so the agent
    can do the thing the hook asked for. It is legal only on the events in
    ``BLOCKABLE_EVENTS``, because no other event has a stop to withhold.

    ``ADVISE`` is neither: text the agent reads and weighs, which is what
    every rule-driven handler is limited to.

    One field with three values rather than a flag per disposition, so a result
    cannot hold two at once. The renderers resolve the dispositions in their own
    order, and a result that was both a refusal and a block would render as
    whichever each renderer happened to test first.

    Members are compared with ``is``, which holds because the entry point at
    the bottom of this file guarantees one module object — and so one ``Kind``
    class — for the whole run. That guarantee is what makes this an ordinary
