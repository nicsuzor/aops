# Analyst

Core principles for reproducible empirical research pipelines. Pair with `dbt`, `streamlit`, or `python-viz` for engine-specific commands.

**Checkpoint discipline**: Take ONE action at a time (chart, model, test), report results and interpretation, and yield to the user before continuing.

## Academic research floor

- **Data immutability**: Source datasets, ground-truth labels, and `records/` are immutable. Never alter or "fix" raw data to fit infrastructure; report gaps instead.
- **Design integrity**: Research questions drive methods. Justify every model, variable, or exclusion by research design, not computational convenience.
- **Pilot before full scale**: Audit sample outputs across all conditions for face validity and edge cases before scaling execution.
- **Fail fast on quality**: Treat data quality anomalies as findings to investigate, not nuisances to smooth over.
- **Report as argument**: State assumptions, limitations, and uncertainties. Align every figure and metric to a specific substantive claim.

## Canonical path resolution

Always resolve database, cache, and data connections from absolute project roots. Never use bare cwd-relative paths (`duckdb.connect("data/...")`).

```python
from pathlib import Path
import duckdb

PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
DB_PATH = (PROJECT_ROOT / "dbt" / "data" / "local_cache.duckdb").resolve()
if not DB_PATH.is_file():
    raise FileNotFoundError(f"Canonical database not found at {DB_PATH}")
conn = duckdb.connect(str(DB_PATH), read_only=True)
```

Keep `data/` completely separate from build output directories (`output/`, `_book/`, `_site/`).

### Troubleshooting "table does not exist"

1. Verify query used the absolute canonical path.
2. Check file size and timestamp (`ls -lh <canonical_path>`).
3. Scan for duplicate databases (`find . -name "*.duckdb"`) and remove them.
4. Verify the model was built into the target database (`dbt run --select <model>`).

## Source-derived parity

Before drawing conclusions or rendering figures from derived tables:

- Assert row counts and key parity between canonical sources (`records/*.yaml`, CSVs) and derived marts.
- Verify content equality on ground-truth columns. Halt on any divergence.

## Layer boundaries

| Layer                                     | Allowed                                                                             | Prohibited                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transformation** (e.g. dbt)             | Cleaning, joins, aggregations, business logic (`stg_*`, `int_*`, `fct_*`, `dim_*`). | Unversioned, ad-hoc execution.                                               |
| **Presentation** (e.g. Streamlit, Quarto) | Reading pre-computed marts, display formatting, widget filtering, rendering charts. | In-line aggregations (`SUM`), joins, `CASE WHEN` logic, metric calculations. |

Never query unmodelled raw sources directly; promote staging models to marts for presentation.

## Testing and validation

- **Schema tests**: Column nullability, uniqueness, accepted values, and foreign keys.
- **Parity tests**: Assert derived tables match canonical source records verbatim with zero dropped keys.
- **Singular tests**: Multi-column assertions, date bounds, and domain logic.
- For LLM outputs: Test content-length minimums and section existence, not brittle error strings.

## Exploration and context discovery

- Read context first: `README.md`, `data/README.md`, and transformation models. See `references/context-discovery.md`.
- Explore clean patterns interactively (one step at a time); isolate data quality issues into reusable scripts in `analyses/`. See `instructions/exploratory-analysis.md`.
- Follow documentation structure in `instructions/research-documentation.md`.

## Statistical methodology

- **Pre-specify tests**: Align statistical tests to research questions before running models to prevent p-hacking.
- **Fix the unit of analysis**: When units are measured repeatedly or across crossed factors (runs, models, raters, criteria), do not treat each observation as independent. Fit on individual observations with random intercepts for each crossed factor and for the full combination, and report the link residual. See `references/unit-of-analysis.md` for the default specification and warning signs.
- **Anti-pattern — "let me just aggregate first"**: Collapsing repeated measurements to a mean, mode, or proportion before fitting is a modelling decision, not data preparation. Before aggregating, state what variance is being discarded; flag any decomposition showing a warning sign in `references/unit-of-analysis.md`.
- **Verify assumptions**: Run `scripts/assumption_checks.py` (`comprehensive_assumption_check()` or components `check_normality`, `check_homogeneity_of_variance`, `check_linearity`, `detect_outliers`) before reporting results.
- **Report completely**: Provide effect sizes and confidence intervals in substantive units; never report p-values in isolation.
- **Label exploratory passes**: Clearly distinguish confirmatory tests from exploratory subgroup analyses.
- **Halt on ambiguities**: Clarify unstated covariates, model parameters, or missing-data strategies with the researcher.
